How to complie and excute my code.
I am buildling my code in vscode and to complie i use the
built in winodws command prompt. In the terminal i cd into the folder where
my java code is kept. To complie i type >javac name_of_file.java, then if i get 
no errors i type > java name_of_file.java and the code compilies an outputs to 
the command prompt. The ouput of my code is expected to be in line with what
the  given test files want to see outputted
